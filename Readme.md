Our paper is currently in press in the Journal of Applied Clinical Medical Physics.

We have labeled 21,775 lesions that were previously unlabeled in the DeepLesion dataset (https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-center-releases-dataset-32000-ct-images).

Our ZIP file contains a total of 54,510 labeled lesions (32,735 original labels + 21,775 new labels) and is divided into training, validation, and testing sets in COCO JSON format.
